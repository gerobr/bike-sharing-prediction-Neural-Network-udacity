Bike-Sharing-Prediction-with-NeuralNet

Developed as coursework for Udacity "Deep Learning Fundamentals" Nanodegree. In this project, I built a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership.
Further Explanation

The Neural network was built NumPy. The goal of this project is to understand what happens behind the neural network before diving deeper into other tools like TensorFlow.
